Summary
-------

The purpose of this PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposal (PLEP) is to clarify
the licensing practices of PlasmaPy repositories. Source code files,
code snippets, and associated documentation shall in general be covered
by a BSD 3-clause license with an explicit patent grant. Other creative
works shall in general be covered by the `Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__. If back and
forth collaboration with a body of work released under a copyleft
license [e.g., the `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA
4.0) license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`__] is
desirable, then a PlasmaPy repository may be licensed under one or more
compatible copyleft licenses. When PlasmaPy adopts or incorporates an
existing body of creative works released under an `Open Source
Initiative (OSI) approved
license <https://opensource.org/licenses/category>`__ or a `Creative
Commons license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/>`__, then that
body of work and its derivatives may continue to use that license.
PlasmaPy’s Coordinating Committee may make exceptions to this policy
when there are extenuating circumstances.

Background information
----------------------

PlasmaPy began development under the permissive `BSD 3-clause
license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__. The primary
advantage of this license is its
`compatibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility>`__
with other licenses. Code released under a BSD license may be used by or
incorporated into software covered by most
`permissive <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence>`__,
`copyleft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft>`__, and
`proprietary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software>`__
licenses. The choice of this license allows back and forth sharing of
code with projects such as `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__ and
`SunPy <http://www.sunpy.org/>`__.

Most modern software licenses include language that protects against
software patents. The `BSD 3-clause license
<https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ does not explicitly
include such language. This oversight leaves potential for a
contributor to patent their contribution, and then later prohibit use
of their contribution by the PlasmaPy community. Plasma physics has a
variety of commercial applications, so it is important to provide
users with protections against software patents. On 2017 October 19,
the patent grant from the `BSD+Patent license
<https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent>`__ was `added to
PlasmaPy’s license <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/114>`__
to give users the right to use contributions even if a contributor
later patents their contribution. This clause covers all contributions
made past this date, and the `contributions made by people who have
agreed to the clause
<https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/licenses/PlasmaPy_LICENSE_preOct2017.md#notice>`__.
The patent clause grants users more rights and protections than the
standard BSD 3-clause license.

Some PlasmaPy repositories contain creative works other than source code
files, code snippets, and associated documentation. `Creative Commons
licenses <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/>`__ are much more
appropriate than open source licenses to cover these other creative
works. Works released under the `CC BY
4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ license may be
shared and adapted as long as attribution is provided. Works released
under the copyleft `CC BY-SA
3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__ or `CC BY-SA
4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`__ licenses may be
shared and adapted as long as attribution is provided and derived works
are covered by either the same license or a compatible license. The `GNU
Free Documentation License
(GFDL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html>`__ is another
commonly used copyleft license.

CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses are compatible with each other in only one
direction. Works released under a CC BY license may be adapted,
redistributed, and relicensed under a CC BY-SA license with attribution.
However, works released under a CC BY-SA license may not be adapted,
redistributed, or relicensed under a CC BY license. Choosing a copyleft
license is often appropriate when back and forth collaboration with
existing bodies of work covered by a copyleft license is desirable. Care
must be chosen to allow two-way licensing compatibility.

PlasmaPy licensing policy
-------------------------

Licensing of software repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Software repositories created by PlasmaPy shall use the following BSD
3-clause license with the explicit patent grant from the OSI-approved
`BSD+Patent license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent>`__.
This license may be used for documentation internal to the project
(e.g., documentation contained within a ``docs`` subdirectory).

   Copyright (c) 2017-2525, PlasmaPy Developers.

   Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
   modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
   are met:

   -  Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

   -  Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in
      the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
      distribution.

   -  Neither the name of PlasmaPy nor the names of its contributors may
      be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
      without specific prior written permission.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each copyright
   holder and contributor hereby grants to those receiving rights under
   this license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the
   conditions of this license) patent license to make, have made, use,
   offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims, already
   acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by such copyright holder
   or contributor that are necessarily infringed by:

   (a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of copyright
       holders and non-copyrightable additions of contributors, in
       source or binary form) alone; or

   (b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work of authorship
       to which such Contribution(s) was added by such copyright holder
       or contributor, if, at the time the Contribution is added, such
       addition causes such combination to be necessarily infringed. The
       patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which
       include the Contribution.

   Except as expressly stated above, no rights or licenses from any
   copyright holder or contributor is granted under this license,
   whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

   .. rubric:: Disclaimer
      :name: disclaimer

   This software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors
   “as is” and any express or implied warranties, including, but not
   limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
   a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall the copyright
   holder or contributors be liable for any direct, indirect,
   incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including,
   but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss
   of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused
   and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict
   liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any
   way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the
   possibility of such damage.

Licensing of creative works other than code and multi-licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creative works besides source code files, code snippets, and
documentation contained within a ``docs`` directory shall by default be
covered by the `CC BY
4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ license.

If significant collaboration with an existing body of creative work
covered by a copyleft license is desired, then a PlasmaPy repository may
be covered by one or more copyleft licenses that provide for two-way
compatibility. In order for a work to be fully compatible with
Wikipedia, for example, it must be both `CC BY-SA
3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`__ and
`GFDL <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent>`__ compatible.

If a repository contains both code and creative content besides code,
then the license file should specify that source code files and code
snippets are released under a `BSD 3-clause
license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ (that is
included in the file) and that all other creative content is released
under an appropriate Creative Commons license (which may be linked to
from the license file). As an example, LaTeX code will be covered under
the `BSD 3-clause
license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__, while the
document created by compiling that code will be covered under a Creative
Commons license.

Licenses that do not allow derivative works or commercial use shall not
be used by PlasmaPy except under extraordinary circumstances.

The following is sample language for a repository that contains code and
other creative content:

   Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
   licensed under the BSD 3-clause license with an added patent grant.
   All other content in this project (including content compiled
   directly from source code and code snippets) is licensed under the
   `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY
   4.0) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ license.

The following is sample language for a repository that contains code as
well as creative content besides code and that allows two-way
`compatibility with
Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights>`__:

   Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
   licensed under a BSD 3-clause license with a patent grant.

   Unless otherwise indicated, all other creative content in this work
   (including content produced directly from unmodified source code and
   code snippets) is released under the `Creative Commons
   Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA
   4.0) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`__ license.
   Original contributions (e.g., contributions that are not derived from
   another work) to this repository may also be shared, adapted, and
   redistributed under the `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
   Unported (CC BY-SA
   3.0) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__ license
   and/or the `GNU Free Documentation License
   (GFDL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html>`__.

Copyright notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A copyright notice must be included in every repository. The phrase
`“All rights
reserved” <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved>`__ no
longer has any legal significance and should not be included.

Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

The Coordinating Committee may adopt different licenses for different
repositories when appropriate, as long as the licenses are on the list
of `OSI approved open source
licenses <https://opensource.org/licenses/category>`__ (or at the very
least unambiguously meet the `definition of open
source <https://opensource.org/osd>`__ as described by OSI). Existing
open source repositories that are incorporated into PlasmaPy may
continue to be licensed under its original license.

Backward Compatibility
----------------------

Versions of PlasmaPy prior to 2017 October 17 will continue to be
available under the `original BSD 3-clause
license <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/licenses/PlasmaPy_LICENSE_preOct2017.md>`__.

Alternatives
------------

Software licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  PlasmaPy could use the `BSD 3-clause
   license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ without the
   patent grant; however this would remove explicit protections against
   software patents.

-  Another alternative would be to use the `Apache License, Version
   2.0 <https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`__ which includes
   specific protections against patents. However, `the naming of the
   Apache license constitutes cultural
   appropriation <https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/660>`__ which
   violates the first bullet point in PlasmaPy’s code of conduct on
   “using welcoming and inclusive language.”

-  PlasmaPy software could be licensed under the copyleft `GNU General
   Purpose License 3.0
   (GPLv3) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__ or weaker
   copyleft `GNU Lesser General Purpose License 3.0
   (LGPLv3) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html>`__. These
   licenses would require that derivative works be covered by the same
   license when being redistributed. These restrictions would prevent or
   restrict use by proprietary packages, but would ensure that
   derivative works continue to be open. A major disadvantage of these
   licenses are that they are not two-way compatible with permissive
   open source licenses, so they would not allow back and forth code
   sharing with permissively licensed packages. The main disadvantage of
   not choosing the GPLv3 or LGPLv3 is that code released under those
   licenses will not be able to be incorporated into a package under
   a different license.

-  Additional alternatives include any of the other `open source
   licenses approved by
   OSI <https://opensource.org/licenses/category>`__.

Licensing of creative works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alternatives include any of the other `Creative Commons
   licenses <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/>`__
   or the `GFDL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html>`__.

   -  The `CC0
      license <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/>`__
      would relinquish the copyright of a creative work to the extent
      allowed by law so that the work is effectively in the public
      domain. This license would remove the attribution requirement
      contained within the CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses. However,
      attribution is beneficial to the scientific process because it
      allows recipients to better understand the origin of an idea or
      data which in turn helps reprodducibility.

   -  Creative Commons licenses that prohibit derivative and/or
      commercial reuse run contrary to the principles associated with
      the `Free/Libre and Open Source Software
      (FLOSS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`__
      movement.

Decision Rationale
------------------

The BSD+Patent license is permissive and contains clear protections
against software patents.  This license is two-way compatible with
code from Astropy and SunPy.  Code under this license or a CC BY
license may be relicensed under most other licenses.  A CC BY-SA
license may be used to allow greater back and forth collaboration with
other works under the same license.  This policy provides additional
flexibility to the Coordinating Committee to deal with extenuating
circumstances.
