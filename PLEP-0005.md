## Brief Description

PlasmaPy final releases will be of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where
`MAJOR`, `MINOR`, and `PATCH` are non-negative integers that are
always present.  During the development phase (when `MAJOR` equals
zero), the public [application programming interface
(API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
should be considered unstable between minor releases.  The first
development release will be in early 2018, with subsequent development
releases occurring every six months.  Version `1.0.0` will occur after
the API has stabilized and PlasmaPy is ready for production use.
Starting with version `1.0.0`, `MAJOR` will be incremented when there
are changes that remove backwards compatibility, `MINOR` will be
incremented when backwards compatible functionality is added, and
`PATCH` will be incremented for bug fixes and other changes that do
not affect the API.  A minor or major release should occur every six
months, with major or long term support (LTS) releases occuring every
other year.

## Versioning Specification

PlasmaPy shall have version numbers that are consistent with the
[Semantic Versioning Specification 
`2.0.0`](appendix-semantic-versioning-specification-semver-200) and
[PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).

Version numbers for PlasmaPy shall be of the following format:

```MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[{a|b|rc}N][.devM]```

The `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, and `PATCH` version numbers must always be
present.  The pre-release tags given in square brackets are optional,
and are absent for final releases which shall be of the form
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.  The pre-release tags are `a` for an alpha
version, `b` for a beta version, and `rc` for a release candidate
version.  The integer `N` shall initially be `0`.  The development tag
`.devM` will be appended to versions undergoing development.  The
integer `M` shall be the commit number.

During the initial development phase, `MAJOR` will be `0` so final
releases will have version numbers of the form `0.MINOR.PATCH`.
`MINOR` shall be incremented whenever the public API changes, and
`PATCH` shall be incremented whenever there are backwards compatible
bug fixes.  The API should be considered unstable during the
development phase and anything may change at any time.

When the API has stabilized sufficiently across all subpackages and
PlasmaPy has developed enough for widespread production use, version
`1.0.0` shall be released.  At this point, the following conditions
will apply:

1. `MAJOR` must be incremented whenever we make incompatible changes
   to the application program interface (API).

2. MINOR must be incremented whenever we add backwards compatible
   functionality.

3. PATCH must be incremented whenever we make backwards compatible bug
   fixes.

### Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) 2.0.0

This section contains the [Semantic Version Specification 
2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) that was authored by Tom
Preston-Werner and shared under a [CC BY
3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.  PlasmaPy
versioning will occur according to this standard.

> #### Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
>
> The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
> “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
> document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
> 2119](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html).
> 
> 1. Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public
>    API. This API could be declared in the code itself or exist
>    strictly in documentation. However it is done, it should be
>    precise and comprehensive.
> 
> 2. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and
>    Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading
>    zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is
>    the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For
>    instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.
>
> 3. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that
>    version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released
>    as a new version.
>
> 4. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything
>    may change at any time. The public API should not be considered
>    stable.
>
> 5. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the
>    version number is incremented after this release is dependent on
>    this public API and how it changes.
>
> 6. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only
>    backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is
>    defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.
>
> 7. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new,
>    backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public
>    API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is
>    marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new
>    functionality or improvements are introduced within the private
>    code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be
>    reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.
>
> 8. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any
>    backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public
>    API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and
>    minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is
>    incremented.
>
> 9. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a
>    series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the
>    patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics
>    and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric
>    identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions
>    have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A
>    pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and
>    might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as
>    denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha,
>    1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.
>
> 10. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a
>     series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the
>     patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only
>     ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST
>     NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining
>     version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the
>     build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples:
>     1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700,
>     1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.
>
> 11. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other
>     when ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the
>     version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in
>     that order (Build metadata does not figure into
>     precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference
>     when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as
>     follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared
>     numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1. When major,
>     minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower
>     precedence than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha <
>     1.0.0. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same
>     major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by comparing
>     each dot separated identifier from left to right until a
>     difference is found as follows: identifiers consisting of only
>     digits are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or
>     hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric
>     identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric
>     identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher
>     precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding
>     identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 <
>     1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 <
>     1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.

## Release Schedule

Version `0.1.0` of PlasmaPy will be released in early 2018 as a
prototype and developer's preview.  Subsequent development releases
should occur no less frequently than every six months, and may occur
more frequently if important new features are added.  Minor releases
during the development phase shall be supported with patch releases
until the next minor release.

Version `1.0.0` will be released once the PlasmaPy core package has a
stable API that users have begun to depend upon.  Releases should occur
no less frequently than every six months.  A major release should
generally happen every two years.  According to this schedule there
should be about three minor releases between each major release.

Long term support (LTS) releases shall occur roughly once every two
years.  LTS releases shall be supported with maintenance and bug fix
patches for at least two years or until the next LTS release,
whichever takes longer.  The Coordinating Committee may optionally
designate a development release for medium or long term support if
there is significant demand and support for it among PlasmaPy users
and developers.  Version `1.0.0` should be an LTS release.  Subsequent
LTS releases should generally be the last minor release for each major
version number.  The Coordinating Committee may alter the LTS release
schedule when appropriate (e.g., when major releases occur more or
less frequently than every two years).

- https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs/pull/8

- [Semantic Versioning: Why You Should Be Using
  It](https://www.sitepoint.com/semantic-versioning-why-you-should-using/)

- A [critique of semantic versioning that proposes "romantic
  versioning"](https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e)

- The SunPy community had a [detailed conversation about switching to
  semantic versioning](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/pull/30).

## Alternatives

There are [numerous versioning
schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Schemes)
that are used by different software projects.  These schemes are
generally less standardized between different projects than semantic
versioning.  Some options include:

- Version numbers may be of the form `YY.MM.PATCH` where `YY`
  corresponds to the last two digits of the year and `MM` corresponds
  to the digits associated with the month of the release.  Ubuntu uses
  this versioning scheme.  The advantage of this scheme is that it
  makes it easier to know when a version is out-of-date.  A
  significant disadvantage is that this scheme provides no information
  on backwards compatibility.

- Some software packages have two versioning schemes.  Public version
  numbers are easily human readable (e.g., by containing the year)
  whereas developers use a versioning scheme that provides more
  information about the state of development.  This alternative is
  less useful for scientific packages where there is less distinction
  between users and developers.
