## Summary

The purpose of this PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposal (PLEP) is to clarify
the licensing practices of PlasmaPy repositories.  Source code files,
code snippets, and associated documentation shall in general be
covered by a BSD 3-clause license with an explicit patent grant.
Other creative works shall in general be covered by the [Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  If back and
forth collaboration with a body of work released under a copyleft
license [e.g., the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA
4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)] is
desirable, then a PlasmaPy repository may be licensed under one or
more compatible copyleft licenses.  When PlasmaPy adopts or
incorporates an existing body of creative works released under an
[Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/category) or a [Creative
Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), then that
body of work and its derivatives may continue to use that license.
PlasmaPy's Coordinating Committee may make exceptions to this policy
when there extenuating circumstances.

## Background information

PlasmaPy began development under the permissive [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).  The primary
advantage of this license is its
[compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility)
with other licenses.  Code released under a BSD license may be used by
or incorporated into software covered by most
[permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence),
[copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), and
[proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)
licenses.  The choice of this license was to follow the established
practices of projects such as [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/).

Most modern software licenses include language that protects against
software patents.  The [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) does not
explicitly include such language.  This oversight leaves potential for
a contributor to patent their contribution, and then prohibit use of
thier contribution by the PlasmaPy community.  Plasma physics has a
variety of commercial applications, so it is important to include
protections against software patents.  On 2017 October 19, the patent
grant from the [BSD+Patent
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent) was [added to
PlasmaPy's license](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/114) to
give users the right to use contributions even if a contributor later
patents their contribution.  This clause covers all contributions made
past this date, and the [contributions made by people who have agreed
to the
clause](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/licenses/PlasmaPy_LICENSE_preOct2017.md#notice).

Some PlasmaPy repositories contain creative works other than source
code files, code snippets, and associated documentation.  [Creative
Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) are much more
appropriate than open source licenses to cover these other creative
works.  Works released under the [CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license may be
shared and adapted as long as attribution is provided.  Works released
under the copyleft [CC BY-SA
3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) or [CC BY-SA
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses may be
shared and adapted as long as attribution is provided and derived
works are covered by either the same license or a compatible license.
The [GNU Free Documentation License
(GFDL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html) is another
commonly used copyleft license.

CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses are one-way compatible.  Works released
under a CC BY license may be adapted, redistributed, and relicensed
under a CC BY-SA license with attribution.  However, works released
under a CC BY-SA license may not be adapted, redistributed, or
relicensed under a CC BY license.  Choosing a copyleft license is
often appropriate when back and forth collaboration with existing
bodies of work covered by a copyleft license is desirable.  Care must
be chosen to allow two-way licensing compatibility.

## PlasmaPy licensing policy

### Licensing of software repositories

Software repositories created by PlasmaPy shall use the following BSD
3-clause license with the explicit patent grant from the OSI-approved
[BSD+Patent license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent).
This license may be used for documentation internal to the project
(e.g., documentation contained within a `docs` subdirectory).

> Copyright (c) 2017-2525, PlasmaPy Developers.
>

> modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions

> this license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
> royalty-free, irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the
> conditions of this license) patent license to make, have made, use,
> offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,

> or contributor that are necessarily infringed by:
>
> (a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of copyright
> holders and non-copyrightable additions of contributors, in source
> or binary form) alone; or
>
> (b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work of authorship
> to which such Contribution(s) was added by such copyright holder or
> contributor, if, at the time the Contribution is added, such
> addition causes such combination to be necessarily infringed. The
> patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which
> include the Contribution.
> 
> Except as expressly stated above, no rights or licenses from any
> copyright holder or contributor is granted under this license,
> whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

> possibility of such damage.

### Licensing of creative works other than code and multi-licensing

Creative works besides source code files, code snippets, and
documentation contained within a `docs` directory shall by default be
covered by the [CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

If significant collaboration with an existing body of creative work
covered by a copyleft license is desired, then a PlasmaPy repository
may be covered by one or more copyleft licenses that provide for
two-way compatibility.  In order for a work to be fully compatible
with Wikipedia, for example, it must be both [CC BY-SA
3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and
[GFDL](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent) compatible.

If a repository contains both code and creative content besides code,
then the license file should specify that source code files and code
snippets are released under a [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (that is
included in the file) and that all other creative content is released
under an appropriate Creative Commons license (which may be linked to
from the license file).  As an example, LaTeX code will be covered
under the [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), while the
document created by compiling that code will be covered under a
Creative Commons license.

Licenses that do not allow derivative works or commercial use shall
not be used by PlasmaPy except under extraordinary circumstances.

The following is sample language for a repository that contains code
and other creative content:

> Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
> licensed under the BSD 3-clause license with an added patent grant.
> All other content in this project (including content compiled
> directly from source code and code snippets) is licensed under the
> [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY
> 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

The following is sample language for a repository that contains code
as well as creative content besides code and that allows two-way
[compatibility with
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights):

> Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
> licensed under a BSD 3-clause license with a patent grant.
>
> Unless otherwise indicated, all other creative content in this work
> (including content produced directly from unmodified source code and
> code snippets) is released under the [Creative Commons
> Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA
> 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.
> Original contributions (e.g., contributions that are not derived
> from another work) to this repository may also be shared, adapted,
> and redistributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
> 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA
> 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license
> and/or the [GNU Free Documentation License
> (GFDL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html).

### Copyright notices

A copyright notice must be included in every repository.  The phrase
["All rights
reserved"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) no
longer has any legal significance and should not be included.

### Exceptions

The Coordinating Committee may adopt different licenses for different
repositories when appropriate, as long as the licenses are on the list
of [OSI approved open source
licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/category) (or at the very
least unambiguously meet the [definition of open
source](https://opensource.org/osd) as described by OSI).  Existing
open source repositories that are incorporated into PlasmaPy may
continue to be licensed under its original license.

## Backward Compatibility

Versions of PlasmaPy will continue to be available under the [original
BSD 3-clause
license](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/licenses/PlasmaPy_LICENSE_preOct2017.md).

## Alternatives

### Software licensing

- PlasmaPy could use the [BSD 3-clause
  license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) without the
  patent grant; however this would remove explicit protections against
  software patents.

- Another alternative would be to use the [Apache License, Version
  2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) which includes
  specific protections against patents.  However, [the naming of the
  Apache license constitutes cultural
  appropriation](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/660) which
  violates the first bullet point of the Contributor Covenant Code of
  Conduct on "using welcoming and inclusive language."

- Software could be licensed under the copyleft [GNU General Purpose
  License 3.0 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
  This license would require that derivative works be covered by the
  same license when being redistributed.  This license would ensure
  that derivative works are covered by the same license and prevent
  use by proprietary packages.  A major disadvantage of this license
  is that it is not two-way compatible with permissive open source
  licenses.

- Additional alternatives include any other [open source licenses
  approved by OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/category).

### Licensing of creative works

- Alternatives include any of the other [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
  or the [GFDL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html).

  - The [CC0
    license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
    would relinquish the copyright of a creative work to the extent
    allowed by law so that the work is effectively in the public
    domain.  This license would remove the attribution requirement
    contained within the CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses.  However,
    attribution is beneficial to the scientific process because it
    allows recipients to better understand the origin of an idea or
    data which in turn helps reprodicibility.

  - Creative Commons licenses that prohibit derivative and/or
    commercial reuse run contrary to the principles associated with
    the [Free/Libre and Open Source Software
    (FLOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
    movement.
